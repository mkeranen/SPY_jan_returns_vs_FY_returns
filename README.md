# SPY_jan_returns_vs_FY_returns
Compares SPY returns in the month of January vs FY SPY returns.

Ultimately, the initial goal of this study was to explore the possibility of:

"January predicts the year" in reference to S&P market growth in the month of January vs FY S&P market growth.

To test this hypothesis, daily SPY data was pulled from the web. A scatterplot was generated with Jan returns as the independent variable
and FY returns as the dependent. The intent was to perform a linear regression analysis in an attempt to form a predictive model.
After visualizing the scatterplot there seems to be no correlation, so the regression analysis was abandoned.

Limitations: As of now, this only includes data from the past 10 years. I have it on my list to update with more historic data when I get a chance.
