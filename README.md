# SPY_jan_returns_vs_FY_returns
Compares SPY returns in the month of January vs FY SPY returns.

Ultimately, the initial goal of this study was to explore the possibility of:

"January predicts the year" in reference to S&P market growth in the month of January vs FY S&P market growth.

To test this hypothesis, daily SPY data was pulled from the web. A scatterplot was generated with Jan returns as the independent variable
and FY returns as the dependent.

A linear regression was performed with January Returns as the potential predictor of Full Year returns. The result is that there is
almost no correlation, which is ultimately unsurprising.
